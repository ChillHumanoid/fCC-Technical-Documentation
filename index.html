<!--Introduction-->
    <section class="main-section" id="introduction">
      <header>Introduction</header>
      <p>Python is a popular programming language used in dozens of careers fields. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. The newest release, Python 3.8, was released in September of 2022.</p>
      <p>It is used for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Web Development (server-side), </li>
        <li> Software Development, </li>
        <li> Mathematics and other similar equations, </li>
        <li> System Scripting, </li>
        <li> Data Analysis, </li>
        <li> and MUCH MORE! </li>

<!--Previous Knowledge-->
    <section class="main-section" id="previous_knowledge">
      <header>Previous Knowledge</header>
      <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background and knowledge: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A general understanding of the difference between front-end and back-end coding languages; Python is a back-end language.</li>
        <li>Some very minimal programming experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don't worry if you have minimal knowledge! Getting started is the hardest part. If Python is too difficult, try out our tutorial on HTML/CSS first.</p>
    </section>

<!--Python Section-->
    <section class="main-section" id="python">
      <header>Python</header>
        <p>Python is great for building the back-end of websites, data analysis, accessing API data, machine learning, and automating repetitive tasks. People use Python in the workplace as well as for personal/fun projects. The possibilities are incredibly vast!</p>
        <p>If you learn Python you can become a Python developer, and you may even get hired at Facebook where you can earn a salary of over $150,000 a year. Of course, there are plenty of other companies who use Python, but that is a popular site that most will be familar with. Some others would include Google, Spotify, Amazon, or even Reddit!</p>
        <p>However, if becoming a developer isn't what you're looking to do â€” you might benefit from knowing that there are many other jobs that use Python these days. </p>
        <p>Everyone from data journalists, scientists, doctors and even product managers are using Python to automate their workdays, help solve complex issues, and overall become more productive in their respective roles.</p>

<!--Hello World Section-->
    <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
      <header>Hello World</header>
      <p>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics. With a little bit of time and practice, reading Python code should become fairly easy.</p>
      <p>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. Look at the code below and think about the similarities and differences between Python and other programming languages such as HTML or CSS.</p>
      <p><i>Example 1:</i></p>
      <code>
        print("Hello World!")
      </code>
      <p><i>Example 2:</i></p>
      <code>
        if 5 > 2 // print("Five is greater than two!")
      </code>
    </section>

<!--Variables Section-->
    <section class="main-section" id="variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
        <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><i>Example 1:</i></p>
        <code>
        x = 5 // print(x); this code would print 5.
        </code>
        <p><i>Example 2:</i></p>
        <code>
        y = "John" // print(y); this code would print John.
        </code>
        <p><i>Example 3:</i></p>
        <code>
        z = "Ranger" // print(z); this code would print Ranger.
        </code>
